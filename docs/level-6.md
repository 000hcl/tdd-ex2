# Level 6: Rotating falling tetrominoes

> Let's keep adding player controls: rotations.

You're now responsible for covering all the corner cases. Here are the features to be implemented:

- a falling piece can be rotated clockwise
- a falling piece can be rotated counter-clockwise
- it cannot be rotated when there is no room to rotate (left wall, right wall, other pieces...)
- when piece is up against a wall (or another piece) and it is rotated, but there is no room to rotate, move it away
  from the wall (["wall kick"](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Wall_kick))
