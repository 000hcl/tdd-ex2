It's time to write your own tests. Here are some example test names, which should be enough to cover all the corner
cases:

- a falling piece can be moved left
- a falling piece can be moved right
- a falling piece can be moved down
- it will not move left over the board
- it will not move right over the board
- it will not move down over the board (will stop falling)
- it cannot be moved left if another piece is in the way
- it cannot be moved right if another piece is in the way
- it cannot be moved down if another piece is in the way (will stop falling)
