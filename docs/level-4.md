# Level 4: Falling tetrominoes

> Previously we have implemented falling blocks and rotating tetrominoes. Next let's put them together.

Open the [test/FallingTetrominoes.test.mjs](../test/FallingTetrominoes.test.mjs) file and implement its tests one by
one.

The `Board` class needs to be updated to work with complex block shapes. It may be useful to temporarily disable the one
failing test, so that you can refactor on green.
