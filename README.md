# TDD MOOC: Tetris Exercise

In this exercise you will be implementing a Tetris game using Test-Driven Development (TDD). The first few dozen tests
have already been written for you - just uncomment them one by one. This should help to get over the initial hurdle of
knowing what tests to write when getting started with TDD. After that the training wheels are removed, and it's time to
write your own tests in the latter part of this exercise.
